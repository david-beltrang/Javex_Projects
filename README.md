<h1 align="center">VEX V5 Robot Programming Projects</h1>

## ðŸ“Œ Description
**VEX V5 Robot Programming Projects**  

This repository is a comprehensive collection of my programming projects for VEX V5 robots, developed as part of the JAVEX team at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana. Using VEXcode Pro V5 and PROS, I contribute code, configurations, and documentation, organized by competition, robot, and date, to showcase practical applications of control algorithms, sensor integration, and autonomous behaviors for VEX V5 platforms.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Project Organization:** Projects are structured by competition, robot type, and date for clear tracking of progress.  
- **Robot Control:** Implement motor control, sensor integration, and autonomous routines using C++.
- **Documentation:**: Each project includes notes on functionality, robot setup, and code explanations.

## ðŸ›  Technical Highlights
- **C++:** for sequence storage and manipulation.  
- **Modular Design:** Separate files for motor configs, sensor logic, and autonomous tasks.
- **Git Integration:** Uses branches and commits for safe experimentation and team collaboration.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
As a member of the JAVEX team at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, this repository serves as a portfolio of my contributions to VEX V5 programming, enabling progress tracking, code reuse, and collaboration within the VEX community. It supports educational and competitive goals by providing a structured archive of robotics projects, adaptable for various VEX V5 challenges.
